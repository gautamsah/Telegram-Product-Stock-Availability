# 🛠️ Implementation Guide & Architecture

This document explains how the **Deals Notification Bot** works under the hood. If you want to modify the code or understand how it bypasses the limits of free cloud hosting, read on!

## Architecture Overview

The bot uses a **Dual-Client Architecture** powered by the `Telethon` Python library.

1. **The User Client**: Connects to Telegram as *you* (using your phone number/session). This is necessary because Telegram Bots cannot read messages in channels unless they are an Admin. Your user account reads the channels silently in the background.
2. **The Bot Client**: Connects to Telegram as your *Bot* (using the Bot Token). This client listens to your chat window, provides the slash commands (`/channels`, `/keywords`), and sends the push notifications to your phone when a deal is found.

Both clients run in the exact same `asyncio` event loop simultaneously inside `bot.py`.

## ☁️ The "Ephemeral Storage" Problem (And Solution)

### The Problem
Free cloud providers (like Render, Heroku, Koyeb) use **Ephemeral File Systems**. This means every time they restart your app (usually once every 24 hours), they wipe the hard drive clean and re-download your code from GitHub. 

If we used a standard `config.json` file to save your keywords and channels, all your settings would be deleted every single day.

### The Solution: Telegram-Native Storage
Instead of saving settings to a file or requiring you to set up a database (like MongoDB), the bot uses Telegram itself as the database.

**How it works:**
1. When the bot starts, it searches its own chat history with you for a message containing `#CONFIG_DATA`.
2. If it finds it, it extracts the JSON text from that message and loads your channels/keywords into memory.
3. If it doesn't find one (e.g., on first startup), it creates a new message with default settings and pins it to the chat.
4. Whenever you use a command like `/add_keyword` or tap an inline button to toggle a channel, the bot modifies the JSON in its memory and **edits the pinned message** to save the changes.

Because the data is stored in the Telegram cloud (inside the message text), it completely survives server restarts!

## Code Breakdown (`bot.py`)

### 1. `load_or_create_config()`
This function runs at startup. It uses `bot_client.iter_messages()` to search your chat history for the config message. 

### 2. `save_config()`
This function takes the `ACTIVE_CONFIG` Python dictionary, converts it to JSON, and edits the pinned `#CONFIG_DATA` message. It's called every time you make a change via a slash command.

### 3. `is_monitored_chat()`
This is the filter function for the User Client. When a message arrives in *any* channel you are a part of, this function checks if that channel's ID exists in your `ACTIVE_CONFIG` and is set to `"enabled": true`. If not, the message is ignored.

### 4. Cooldown System
To prevent spam (e.g., if a channel posts 5 messages about the same sale in 10 seconds), the bot tracks `COOLDOWNS`. When a deal is found in a channel, it records the timestamp. It will ignore any further deals from that specific channel for the next 15 seconds (configurable).

## 🗑️ Chat Auto-Cleanup

Because this bot is designed to run 24/7 and push deals to you constantly, the chat could quickly become cluttered with thousands of messages. 

To solve this, the bot includes a background `auto_clean_chat` asyncio task that wakes up every 1 hour. It fetches the chat history, preserves the newest 200 messages, and permanently deletes anything older than that. 

Crucially, it is programmed to **never delete the pinned `#CONFIG_DATA` message**, ensuring your settings are always protected from the sweeping process. You can toggle this behavior using `/toggle_cleanup`.

## 📱 Slash Command Auto-Registration

If you type `/` in standard Telegram bots, a native menu pops up showing you all available commands. Normally, bot creators have to manually register these with `@BotFather`. 

To make deployment as easy as possible, the bot leverages `SetBotCommandsRequest` from the Telethon API. The moment the bot connects to the server, it automatically pushes its internal command list (like `/channels`, `/keywords`) straight to the Telegram servers, immediately unlocking the native popup menu on your phone!

## 🔗 URL Unshortener & Metadata Extraction

To deal with obfuscated affiliate links (like `amzn.to` or `bit.ly`), the bot includes a background HTTP fetcher using the `aiohttp` library.

When the `user_client` detects a matching deal message:
1. It uses a regular expression to extract all URLs from the raw text.
2. It launches an asynchronous HTTP GET request for each URL, allowing the server to follow all HTTP `301` and `302` redirects.
3. Once it hits the final destination, it parses the HTML response using a regex to grab the `<title>` tag (giving us the product name).
4. The `bot_client` then fires off a secondary message containing the clean product titles, keeping the actual direct URLs neatly hidden behind a standard `[Link]` markdown hyperlink to prevent chat clutter!
